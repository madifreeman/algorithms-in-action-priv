# Quick Sort

---

Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It first divides the input array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays. The steps for Quicksort are:

* Pick the right-most element of the array, called a pivot.

* Partitioning: reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.

* Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.

The base case of the recursion is arrays of size zero, which are in order by definition, so they never need to be sorted.

The pivot selection and partitioning steps can be done in several different ways; the choice of specific implementation schemes greatly affects the algorithm's performance.
